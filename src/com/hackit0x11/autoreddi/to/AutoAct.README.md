Autoreddi.to Codebase and Kotlin Guide

Overview:
Autoreddi.to is an Android app with a splash-driven flow, a main activity using a WebView, periodic remote checks via a service, and several helper utilities. The codebase is moving from Java to Kotlin for safety and clarity.

Directory Structure (relative to src/com/hackit0x11/autoreddi/to/):
- AutoAct.java or AutoAct.kt
- QueRicko.java or QueRicko.kt
- Servodeiservideiservi.java or Servodeiservideiservi.kt
- SplashScreen.java or SplashScreen.kt
- utility.java or utility.kt

Component Explanations:

SplashScreen:
Purpose: The entry point activity. Shows a splash screen, manages a first-run dialog, checks a remote status, and then launches the main app.
Logic: On first run, shows an info dialog and pings a remote server. It checks a remote URL to determine if "burla" mode should be activated. If not in burla mode, it starts a background service. It listens for broadcasts to close itself early.

AutoAct:
Purpose: The main activity. Contains a WebView for the app's main content.
Logic: Loads local HTML and JavaScript. Handles menu actions and JavaScript interface. Listens for broadcasts from the service to update UI or behavior.

QueRicko:
Purpose: Info or about screen, sometimes used for a Rickroll. Displays styled text with clickable links.
Logic: Loads an HTML-formatted string from resources and displays it in a TextView.

Servodeiservideiservi:
Purpose: Background service for periodic remote checks.
Logic: Periodically sends HTTP requests to a URL. If a condition is met, broadcasts a result to the app.

utility:
Purpose: Helper object or class with reusable methods.
Logic: Provides static methods for HTTP networking, dialog display, and other common tasks.

General App Flow:
1. The app starts at SplashScreen.
2. If this is the first run, an info dialog is shown and a "first run" network ping is sent.
3. A remote URL is checked for "burla" mode. If burla mode is enabled, special behavior is triggered and the splash may be skipped. If not, the background service (Servodeiservideiservi) is started.
4. After the splash, AutoAct (the main activity) is launched.
5. The user interacts with the WebView in AutoAct. QueRicko can be opened for info.
6. The background service can send broadcasts to update parts of the app.

Kotlin Basics Used in the Project:

Class Declaration:
class AutoAct : Activity() { ... }

Null Safety:
var notNull: String = "hi"
var canBeNull: String? = null

Companion Object (for static values):
companion object {
    const val ACTION_CLOSE = "canigonfi.ACTION_CLOSE"
}

Property Initialization:
lateinit var bar: ProgressBar

Lambda Functions:
Handler().postDelayed({
    // code to run after delay
}, 2000)

String Templates:
val name = "world"
println("Hello, $name!")

Data Classes:
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

How It All Fits Together:
The app launches SplashScreen first. If this is the first run, the user sees an info dialog and a tracking ping is sent. The splash screen checks a remote URL for burla mode. If burla mode is on, the splash is skipped and special features are enabled. If not, the background service is started to keep checking the remote condition. After a short delay, the app launches AutoAct, where the user interacts with the main features of the app, primarily through a WebView. QueRicko is available as an info or about screen. The utility object provides reusable code for networking and dialogs.

Updating the App:
- To change the splash duration, edit SplashScreen.
- To change the first-run dialog text or layout, edit SplashScreen and the relevant resources.
- To update remote check logic, edit Servodeiservideiservi and utility.
- To alter the main UI or menus, edit AutoAct.
- To update the info/about screen, edit QueRicko.
- To add or change helper functions, edit utility.

Tips for Kotlin Migration:
- Replace findViewById with property access or view binding.
- Use null safety features (the ? symbol) and lateinit for variables initialized later.
- Use lambdas for concise background and delayed actions.
- Use companion objects for constants and static-like values.
- Prefer data classes for simple data containers.
- Use string templates for building messages.
